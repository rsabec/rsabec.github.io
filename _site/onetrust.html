<div>onetrust test</div>
<div>onetrust modal would theoretaically be showing now</div>
</br>

<div>CM explicit is on by 'load rule' for all pages on this test page but our modal display is turned off with cmgeneral template edit - all other explicit modal behaviour is still active</div>
<div>If you did not want tags held on 'all pages' then adjust the <a href="https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/iQ-Tag-Management/Explicit-Consent-Prompt-Manager/ta-p/22714">'Explicit Consent Prompt Manager'</a>  </div>
</br>
<div>CM explicit hold all tags but omit listed tag(s) and waits for consent decision to fire all queued events</div>

<div>onetrust should provide method to attach to their consent decision in their modal and pass the value(s) on the first page ( or anytime it is displayed and consent is changed) -</div>
</br>
<div> test in the console with utag.gdpr.setConsentValue(1);</div>
<div>this will trigger the tags held on the first page and set the CONSENTMGR cookie</div>
</br>

<div>you would still need a preloader extension to read the onetrust cookie and write the CONSENTMGR cookie since onetrust recreates their cookies when deleted while we do not automatically remake the CONSENTMGR cookie </div>
<div>we also would need the 'categories' in the onetrust consent decision and how they relate to the available 15 categories in the <a href="https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/iQ-Tag-Management/Consent-Preferences-Manager/ta-p/22715">Consent Preferences Manage</a></div>
<div>the update to the cmGeneral template is one line that deactivates our prompt so it does not display</div>
