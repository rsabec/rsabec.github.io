# Maple Oat Pecan Scones

Preheat oven - Convection 400 F

When mixing dough, less is more, only mix enough to incorporate.

3 1/2 cups ( 17.5oz or 1lb 1.5oz ) all purpose flour - APF

1 cup ( 5oz ) whole wheat flour

1 cup oats.  ( this can be Coach's Oats or Quaker Oats - you can experiments with which one you like better or use the one you have on hand )

2 tablespoons sugar

2 tablespoons baking powder

2 teaspoons salt

1lb cold unsalted butter - cut into small diced pieces.

1/2 cup chilled maple syrup ( preferably Vermont )

1/2 cup chilled water + 2 tablespoons Saco cultured buttmilknpowder ( or 1/2 cup buttermilk )

4 large eggs - plus one beaten egg for final egg wash

1 cup lightly roasted and hand crushed pecans ( you can roast raw pecans in 375 oven till fragrant - about 6 minutes, then let cool to room temp before adding to recipe )


I use a baking sheet with a Sitpat but parchment paper can be used in place of the Sitpat. Mix together most Dry ingredients including cultured buttermilk powder ( not the pecans ) .  Dice up cold to frozen butter and add to mixer on low.  I will typically cover the mixer bowl with a towel to stop spit-out and increase speed of mixer to pulverized and break up the butter chunks.  With mixer on low add wet ingredients (maple syrup, eggs and water all together lightly beaten or mixed before adding into mixer). As the dough is coming together in the mixer add the hand crushed pecans. Adding pecans near the end will help maintain the larger chunks. Empty out the evenly mixed dough out and divide into two balls.  Roll out each into the desired thickness and cut into wedges.  I typically get 8 scones per dough ball or 16 in total.  Place on cookie sheet with Silpat, brush with egg wash and sprinkle additional sugar. Place into a 400-degree oven for about 22 minutes, turn once halfway through.  Remove and cool on rack.

Serve warm with your favorite jam or preserves.

Enjoy!
