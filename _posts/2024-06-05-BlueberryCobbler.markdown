# Blueberry Cobbler

Berries

4 1/2 cups fresh blueberries with either lemon zest and juice or rasberries.

1/3 cup sugar

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour or corn starch

Consider adding Vanlla or cinnamon for a vairation. - 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract and or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon in to berries or scone dough ?

Dough  

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1 1/2 tablespoons sugar

2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into diced into small  pieces ( or grated on a cheese grater ? )

3/4 cup chilled water + 3 tablespoons Saco cultured buttmilknpowder ( or 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.

( should you add an egg ? )

<p>Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries, place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour. Set aside.
Dice up cold to frozen butter and add to mixer on low.  I will typically cover the mixer bowl with a towel to stop spit-out and increase speed of mixer to pulverized and break up the butter chunks.  With mixer on low add wet ingredients (cream and or butter milk, eggs ( if using powder butermilk then water) all together lightly beaten or mixed before adding into mixer. brush with egg wash and sprinkple with sugar </p>

<p>Put the blueberries mixture into a baking dish. Make 1/2 thick scone sized dogh patties. Place them on top of the berries. Bake until the topping is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it, about 35 to 40 minutes.</p>
