I typically use my personal site for testing `tags` that require https or to provide a way to demo features or a POC to a client. When deciding to move to [Github pages][github-pages] consider that it is free but limited to only serving flat static html pages.  For me this required changing from my original Angular into page into 'something else'. I knew I was not interested in the time to manually creating individual HTML pages so enter 'jekyll'.  Github supports [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] that helps build your site and provides a built in way to locally preview and test changes.

Setting up `jekyll` and `GitHub Pages` only required basic programming skills and beginner Github experience.  I would recommend using GitHub Pages for your personal site.
