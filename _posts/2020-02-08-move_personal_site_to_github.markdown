I typically use my personal site for testing `tags` that require https or to provide a way to demo features or a POC to a client. Moving to [Github pages][github-pages] is free but limited to only serving flat static html pages requiring a change from my original Angular into page.  Github does support [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] that helps build your site and allows you to locally preview and test changes.

Setting up `jekyll` only requires basic programming skills and beginner Github experience.  I would recommend using GitHub Pages for your personal site.
