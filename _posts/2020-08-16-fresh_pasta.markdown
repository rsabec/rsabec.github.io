# Fresh Egg and Extruded Pasta -

These are my notes when experimenting with flour and moister ration in doughs for extruded and egg pasta.  Extruded pasta will typically be a much drier dough.  

# -Fresh Egg Pasta - 

	2 cups ( 10oz ) APF 
	2 cups ( 11oz ) Tipo 00 flour
	One pinch salt
	6 large eggs ( 10.5oz)
	2 tablespoons ( 1oz ) olive oil 

TFW = 21oz
TW = 11.5oz + 21oz = 32.5oz
IP = 54%


# -Extruded Pasta 1 - 
	
	10oz APF or 00 or ratio
	4 to 4.5oz H2O
	4 large eggs ( 7oz - 1 egg == 1.75oz )
	1 3/4 semolina 5.5oz/cup 9.62 oz 
	1 3/4 APF 5/oz 8.75oz 
	1 tablspoon water
	1 teaspoon saly
	4 large eggs 7/8 cup liquid volume. 7oz

TFW = 18.37
TW = 25.87
40% H2O

# -Extruded Pasta 2 - Bob's Redmill
	
	2 tablespoons olive oil 1oz
	2 tablespoons water 1oz
	2 eggs 2.5oz
	1/2 teaspoon salt

54% H2O
