I"À<p>I typically use my personal site for testing client side <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code> that require https or to provide a way to demo features or a POC to a client. When deciding to move to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> consider that it is free but limited to only serving flat static html pages.  For me this required changing from my original Angular into page into â€˜something elseâ€™. I knew I was not interested in the time to manually creating individual HTML pages so enter â€˜jekyllâ€™.  Github supports <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> that helps build your site and provides a built in way to locally preview and test changes.</p>
