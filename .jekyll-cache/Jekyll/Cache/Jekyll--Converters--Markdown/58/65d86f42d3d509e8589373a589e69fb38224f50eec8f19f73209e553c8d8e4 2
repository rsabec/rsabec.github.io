<p>Preheat oven - Convection 375 F</p>

<p>When mixing dough, less is more, only mix enough to incorporate.</p>

<p>Use less to no sugar depending on how sweet the blueberries are.</p>

<p>3 cups ( 15oz ) all purpose flour - APF</p>

<p>1 cup ( 4oz ) cake flour - not self rising</p>

<p>6 tablespoons sugar ( see note above )</p>

<p>5 teaspoons baking powder</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>

<p>8 ounces cold unsalted butter</p>

<p>1 cup ( 1/2 pint ) blueberries</p>

<p>1 cup chilled water + 4 tablespoons Saco cultured buttmilknpowder ( or 1 cup buttermilk )</p>

<p>2 large eggs - plus one beaten egg for final egg wash</p>

<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>

<p>I use a baking sheet with a Sitpat but parchment paper can be used in place of the Sitpat. Mix together Dry ingredients including cultured buttermilk powder.  Dice up cold to frozen butter and add to mixer on low.  I will typically cover the mixer bowl with a towel to stop spit-out and increase speed of mixer to pulverized and break up the butter chunks.  With mixer on low add wet ingredients plus blueberries.  Empty out the evenly mixed dough out and divide into two balls.  Roll out each into the desired thickness and cut into wedges.  I typically get 8 scones per dough ball or 16 in total.  Place on cookie sheet with Silpat, brush with egg wash and then into 375-degree oven for 22 minutes, turn once halfway through.  Remove and cool on rack.</p>
