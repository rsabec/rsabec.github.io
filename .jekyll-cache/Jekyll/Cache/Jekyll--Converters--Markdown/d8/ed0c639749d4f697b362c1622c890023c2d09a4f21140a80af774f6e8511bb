I"í<p>I typically use my personal site for testing client side <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tags</code> that require https or to provide a way to demo features or a POC to a client. When deciding to move to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> I considered that it is free but limited to only serving static html pages.  This required changing my original Angular page into â€˜something elseâ€™. I knew I was not interested in spending the time to manually create individual HTML pages, so enter â€˜jekyllâ€™.  Github supports <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> that helps build your site and provides a built in way to locally preview and test changes.</p>

<p>Setting up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GitHub Pages</code> only required basic programming skills and beginner Github experience.  I would recommend using GitHub Pages for your personal site.</p>
