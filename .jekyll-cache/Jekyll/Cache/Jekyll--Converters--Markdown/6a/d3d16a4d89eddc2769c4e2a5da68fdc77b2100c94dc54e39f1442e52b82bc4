<p>Berries</p>

<p>4 1/2 cups fresh blueberries with either lemon zest and juice or rasberries.</p>

<p>1/3 cup sugar</p>

<p>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour or corn starch</p>

<p>Dough</p>

<p>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</p>

<p>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</p>

<p>1 1/2 tablespoons sugar</p>

<p>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>

<p>6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into diced into small  pieces</p>

<p>3/4 cup chilled water + 3 tablespoons Saco cultured buttmilknpowder ( or 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.</p>

<p>Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries, place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour. Set aside.
Dice up cold to frozen butter and add to mixer on low.  I will typically cover the mixer bowl with a towel to stop spit-out and increase speed of mixer to pulverized and break up the butter chunks.  With mixer on low add wet ingredients (cream and or butter milk, eggs ( if using powder butermilk then water) all together lightly beaten or mixed before adding into mixer. </p>

<p>Put the blueberries mixture into a baking dish. Make 1/2 thick scone sized dogh patties. Place them on top of the berries. Bake until the topping is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it, about 35 to 40 minutes.</p>
