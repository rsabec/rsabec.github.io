<p>6 boneless sort ribs ( one Costco short rib package ).</p>

<p>One medium yellow onion diced.</p>

<p>Three whole garlic cloves smashed and peeled.</p>

<p>Eight springs thyme.</p>

<p>10 to 12 whole peppercorns.</p>

<p>1 teaspoon salt.</p>

<p>Two bay leaves.</p>

<p>1/4 cup APF.</p>

<p>One bottle red wine ( Masi Campofiorin or similar blend )</p>

<p>Two diced carrot.</p>

<p>Four diced celery stalks.</p>

<p>3 tablespoon olive oil ( twice if you remove and replace oil after browing the meat ).</p>

<p>Two tablesppos butter.</p>

<p>Two tablespoons tomato paste.</p>

<p>Beef stock ( enough to add to cover meat - 6 to 10 oz.)</p>

<p>Cut each of the long short ribs info three sections. Layer these with the onion, thyme, garlic in a food grade container that will hold all the beef and wine. ( Cambro square 4 quart container ) Do not add the carrots and celery to the marinade.  Add peppercorns, salt and entire bottle of wine.  Cover with lid and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Remove short ribs from wine and dry meat.  Researve the wine and veggies/herbs. Season each piece with salt and pepper then dredge in APF.  Add olive oil to oven proof pot or dutch oven. Brown beef in stages to not crowd the pan.  While browing meet seperate wine from onions/garlic/herbs using a strainer,  keeping the ‘wine’ reserved.  Once the last of beef is browned, remove oil from pot and add new olive oil with 2 tablespoons butter.  Add all veggies to pot, including the carrots and celery with the strained items used in the marinade. Saute till onions are translucent, watch heat to not burn garlic cloves.  Add tomato paste, stir in and cook for a few minutes. Pour in reseved red wine and bring to a boil then simmer apporx ten minutes.  Add salt pepper to initially adjust to taste.  Add Beef to pot and then top off with beef stock to just cover meet.  Bring to a simmer, cover and put in 350F oven.  Remove post every 45 minutes to stir and check for tenderness of meat.  Usualy 90 minutes total in oven is sufficient.  If you want to carmelize the beef and stew more then remove or leave lid askew when placing pot back in after the first 45 minutes.  Make any final seasoning adjustments now. Serve with a slice of good artisan bread with butter. :)</p>
