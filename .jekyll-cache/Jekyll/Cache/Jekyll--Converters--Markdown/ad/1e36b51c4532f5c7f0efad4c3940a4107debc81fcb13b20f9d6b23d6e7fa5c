I"¹<p>Find and open an existing post - Copy and save as new post if creating a new post.</p>

<p>Open Terminal and change your directory to the jekyll site saved locally on your localhost. 
cd Documents/GitHub/rsabec.github.io/</p>

<p>Update the file contents</p>

<p>run command to compile and load your site - bundle exec jekyll serve</p>

<p>you can then test your site locally - typically this address with ll be http://127.0.0.1:4000/</p>

<p>Setting up <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GitHub Pages</code> only required basic programming skills and beginner Github experience.  I would recommend using GitHub Pages for your personal site.</p>
