I"À<p>I typically use my personal site for testing <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code> that require https or to provide a way to demo features or a POC to a client. Moving to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> is free but limited to only serving flat static html pages requiring a change from my original Angular into page.  Github does support <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> that helps build your site and allows you to locally preview and test changes.</p>

<p>Setting up <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> only requires basic programming skills and beginner Github experience.  I would recommend using GitHub Pages for your personal site.</p>
